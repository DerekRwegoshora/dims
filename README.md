An online pharmacy management and operations system built to automate and simplify basic everyday pharmacy tasks and operations, designed to mitigate the challenges experienced by Morogoro's local pharmacies (2019).
Created for the fulfillment of my associate/diploma degree program with the additional objective of solving a community problem.

***Use xampp version 2014-2015 for maximum performance and compatibiliy. I'm yet to update the code to be compatible with the current syntax (mysql"i")***
Use any good web browser after installing XAMPP and then use the login.php page to login into the system.
Default passwords:
Admins = admin/derek
Password = admin/derek
To obtain the credentials for pharmacist, simply create one with using the admin acccount.

***Note: This README was created years after this iteration of the system was designed, a few things may not be accurate!***
Thank you!!!
